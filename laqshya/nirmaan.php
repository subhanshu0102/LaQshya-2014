										<h2>About "Nirmaan"</h2>
									</header>
									<p> Ever felt like trying your hand at structure designing ? Ever wondered how it would feel if you could construct something that could make a difference ?  This event at Laqshya-2014 tests the mettle of student to come up with a model of bridge with an innovative and path-breaking idea with attractive prize money at stake. Design a resource and time optimized structure that satisfies the constraints mentioned in the problem.</p>

									<h3>Rules</h3>
									<p>   
										#	The event will be held in two rounds.<br>
										#	The final testing of the structures will be done on the same day of completion of event.<br>
										<u>Round 1:</u><br> 
										#   To build a model of given prototype. <br>
										#	A model is to be made from ice cream sticks and fevicols.<br>
										#	The no. of sticks provided will be limited and no extra sticks will be given except replacement of the defective sticks.<br>
										#	The model should be made in limited time.<br>
										#	If two models are made in same time then judgement will be based upon the accuracy of the model.<br>
										<u>Round 2:</u><br> To build a bridge.<br>
										#	Teams will be provided with a problem statement specifying the details of the bridge.<br>
										#	Team will have to construct a bridge structures based on certain restrictions and parameters given at the time of the competition, within a given time frame.<br>
										#	Materials (ice cream sticks, tissue paper, fevicol and thread) will be provided, which will be same for all.<br>
										#	All intricate rules and regulation will be revealed on the spot.<br>

										<u>JUDGEMENT PARAMETERS:</u> 
										The judging parameter will be based on dimensional,geometrical accuracy of given Bridge.
