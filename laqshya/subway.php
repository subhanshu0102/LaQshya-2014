										<h2>About "Subway Surfer"</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The object of the game is to run one's hooligan character as far as possible through an endless game world by avoiding randomly generated obstacles that require the player to either jump (slide finger forward), duck (slide finger backwards) and/or dodge the oncoming trains (slide finger laterally) in a precise manner with the help of occasional power-ups. Game play takes place in graphical 3-D perspective. Player characters collect coins as they run; occasionally they surf on hoverboards, jump over or roll under objects, soar over the train tracks, and even run along overhead wires. Special missions reward players with bonus for accomplishing precise tasks. Upon a wipeout, characters occasionally appear to smash into the screen. This  wall gag has predecessors in Crash Bandicoot and the 1999 Pepsiman videogame on PlayStation.</p>
