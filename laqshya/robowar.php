										<h2>About "Robowars"</h2>
									</header>
									<p>War is an organized and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by parties wishing to control or destroy the other one. It is characterized by extreme aggression, damage and usually high mortality. The combat between the two , decide the one who is mightiest, where the mercy is a taboo word and gallantry is inevitable. A contest to lash out the opponent and thrash him till it relinquishes the battle ground.
										Flying blades, violent flame throwers, the thrashing sound of metal and a junk pile of annihilated machines, welcome to the world of combat robotics. LaQshya 2014 brings to you Gladiators- Inter college combat robotics competition, a modern day Coliseum for the next generation of war machines, the battles for supremacy can never get bigger than this..

									<h3>Rules</h3>
									<p>#	A robot is declared victorious if its opponent is immobilized.<br>
										#	Duration of each round will be of 3 minutes.<br>
										#	Only 2 timeouts will be given (each of 10 min.) during the whole tournament but not in a single round. And both robots must not be in entangled condition.<br>
										#	A competitor will be declared as immobile if it cannot display linear motion of at least 1 inch in a time period of 30 seconds. A robot with 1 side of its drive train disable will not be counted out if it can demonstrate some degree of controlled movement.<br>
										#	Point will be given on the basis of Aggression and damage.<br>
										#	Maximum duration of semi-final and final match will be decided at the time of event.<br>
										#	The machine will be checked whether it is safe or not for other participants and spectators. If it is unsafe then it will be discarded.<br>
										#	Participants have to bring their own robotic kits.<br>

										Round 1:<br>
										#	This will be a knock out round.<br>
										#	2 teams will be playing against each other and based upon the point scored, they will score for the next round.<br>
										Round 2:<br>
										#	In this round, again a knock out match will be played.<br>
										#	Team will be qualified for next round on the basis of following criterion :<br>
										#	If opponent becomes immobile during the match.<br>
										#	If both the robots remain mobile during whole match then winner will be decided on the basis of the point scored.<br>
										#	Number of qualifying team will be declared on the spot.<br>
										Safety Rules:<br>
										#	All the participants must build and operate robots at their own risk. Combat robotics is inherently dangerous. There is no amount of regulations that can encompass all the dangers involved. Please take care not to hurt yourself or others when building, testing and competing.<br>
										#	If you have a robot or weapon design that does not fit within the set categories of rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event manager.<br>
										#	All weapons must have safety cover on sharp edges when the match is not being played.<br>
									</p>
									<h3>Specifications</h3>
									<p><u>Arena:</u> <br>
										#	A square shape arena with dimension (400cm*400cm).<br>
										#	Arena will be made up of cement floor and rubber painted surrounded by wire cage.<br>
										<u>Robot:</u><br>
										#	The Robot should not exceed the dimension of 750mm*750mm*1000mm (L*B*H) at every given point of game. External devices which are used for controlling the robot are not included in the size constraint.<br>
										#	Weight of a Robot should not exceed 50 kg.<br>
										#	Robot can be controlled through wireless technique i.e. both ON and OFF board power supplies are allowed.<br>
										#	If Robot is controlled through wired mechanism then wire must remain slack under all circumstances throughout the competition.<br>
										#	If Robot is controlled through wireless mechanism then it must have a dual frequency remote control circuit or 2 control circuits which may be interchanged before the commencement of the competition, to avoid the frequency interface with other teams.<br>
										#	Remote control systems available in market can be used.<br>

										<u>Source of Power:</u><br>
										#	Robot has to be powered through electrical mechanism only; use of IC engine is not allowed.<br>
										#	Batteries must be sealed, immobilized electrolyte types (such as gel cells, lithium, NiCad, NiMH or dry cells).<br>
										#	The voltage should not exceed more than 36 V DC at any point of time.<br>
										#	All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing fire in a battery.<br>


										<u>Pneumatics:</u><br>
										#	Robot can use pressurized inflammable gases to activate pneumatic devices.<br>
										#	Maximum allowed pressured is 8 bars.<br>
										#	Participants must be able to indicate the used pressure with integrated or temporarily fitted pressure gauge.<br>
										#	The maximum pressure in cylinder should not exceed the rated pressure at any point of time.<br>

										<u>Hydraulics:</u><br>
										#	Robot can use pressurized liquid to actuate hydraulics devices e.g. cylinders.<br>
										#	All hydraulic components onboard a robot must be securely mounted. Particular attention must be made to pump and accumulator mounting and armour to ensure that if ruptured direct fluid streams should not escape.<br>
										#	All hydraulic liquids are required to be non corrosive and your device should be leak proof.<br>
										#	Maximum allowed pressure is 8 bar.<br>
										#	Participant must be able to indicate the used pressure with integrated or temporarily fitted pressure gauge.<br>

										<u>Weapon Systems:</u><br>
										#	Robots can have any kind of cutters, flippers, saws, lifting devices etc  as weapons with following exceptions and limitations:<br>
										#	Liquid projectile.<br>	
										#	Any kind of flammable liquids.<br>
										#	Flame based weapons.<br>
										#	Any kind of explosive or intentionally ignited solid.<br>
										#	Nets, tapes, glue, or any entanglement device.<br>
										#	Radio jamming, tazers, tesla coils, or any other high voltage device.<br>
										#	Tethered projectiles are allowed with a maximum tether length of 4 feet.<br>
