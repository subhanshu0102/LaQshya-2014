										<h2>About "wrestle Mania"</h2>
									</header>
									<p>With the proliferation of sports channels it’s more than likely you’ve clicked across a sumo match and wondered at this strange sport. But there’s more to sumo than just two men wrestling in the ring- in fact, it’s an ancient and treasured sport in Japan. And it’s becoming more and more popular outside of its homeland as the world grows ever smaller in this new age technology.</p>

										<h5>Out:</h5>
										•	A robot loses a round when any portion of the robot touches outside of the ring. It doesn’t matter if the robot falls out on its own or is pushed out.<br>
										•	The first robot touching outside of the ring loses, even if the second robot subsequently touches outside of the ring. If the referee determines that both robots touched outside of the ring at the same time the round is nullified and started over.<br>
										•	If any piece of the robot, no matter how small or even if detached, touches outside of the ring, the robot is considered out. For example, if a nut drops off a robot within the ring, the robot doesn’t immediately lose. However, if the nut is then pushed out or rolls out, the robot loses.<br>
										<h5>General:</h5>
										•	Fair chance given to all participants.<br>
										•	All arena dimensions have a tolerance of 5%. <br>
										•	Each team should have unique participants i.e. no two teams can have even a single participant common.<br>
										•	The right spirit of participation is expected from the participants.<br>
										•	The robots must not harm the arena in any way. If it does so, a penalty will imposed on the team. The magnitude of the penalty will be decided by referee.<br>
										•	The decision of the referee will be final and binding. <br>
										<h5> Referee Stoppage:</h5>
										•	At the referee’s discretion, the referee may choose to restart a round if: three minutes have expired; No progress has been made in some period of time; the robot fail to touch each other for some period of time; the robots are hopelessly entangled or otherwise deadlocked; both robots fail to start or both contestants signal stoppage. At the referee’s discretion, the referee may choose to end a round and choose the round winner if smoke, fire, damage, or any other violation has occurred. No problem is likely to be made even if the round is restarted.<br>
										
										
										
										
										
										<h5>Harmlessness:</h5>
										•	At all times, robot behavior must be non-offensive, non-destructive, and non-harmful to humans, robots, and the facilities. This is an immutable principle, even if the behavior is unintentional or not by design.<br>
										•	During inspection (and at any time during the event), the judges may require safety changes or other modifications to meet the harmlessness requirement. Harmful robots are either not allowed to complete at all or are later disqualified if potential harmful issues are proven or revealed in battle.<br>
										•	Survive the expected pushing, shoving, and physical rigors of competition. Suggestions may be made to avoid damage to the robot. A weak robot is usually allowed to complete at its own risk.<br>
										•	During the contest, the judge must determineif a robot’s failure was due to its own lack of durability.<br>
										•	Failures due to exposed wires or unsecured or flimsy parts shall be the responsibility of the robot with such weakness.<br>
										•	At all times, sumo robots must not.<br>
										o	Emit smoke or fire.<br>
										o	Leak, stain, or soil.<br>
										o	Disperse powder, grit, or grime.<br>
										o	Spray, throw, or use projectiles.<br>
										o	Jam, shock, or electromagnetically interface.<br>
										o	Snare, entangle, or employ nets/rope.<br>
										o	Scratch, gouge, or scrape.<br>
										•	However, as for the last point, naturally some damage occurs from scoops, changes in starting orientation, and from the battles themselves. This is expected and acceptable to any reasonable extent.<br>
										<h5> Things To Be Taken Care Of: </h5><br>
										•	Suction, glue, sticky wheels, magnets, or other methods of increasing downward force will not be allowed. A common method of determining a violation is to place the robot on a piece of  paper and lift up the robot to see if the paper lifts too and if this kind of activity is found out then it can lead to disqualification.<br>
