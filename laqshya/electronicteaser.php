										<h2>About "Electronic Teaser"</h2>
									</header>
									<p>An on spot event to test very basics of electronics as well as it gives us immense opportunity to showcase your skills at designing and implementing electronic circuits. Teams will be given a problem statement and they have to solve it by using components provided (ICs, breadboard, logic gates etc.) within the stipulated time to prove their dominance over silicon.</p>

								<h3>Rules</h3>
								<p>#	There will be 2 rounds.<br>
									#	The team which detect the component {(3rd & 4th)}/ identify symbol {(1st & 2nd) year} in minimum time will selected for next round.<br>
									# The team which completes the circuit in final round with minimum time will be selected as the winner .
									<u>ROUND 1:</u><br>
									#	Symbol identifications for (1st & 2nd) year .component identifications for (3rd & 4th) year.<br>
									#	Selected team identifying the maximum symbol and components (with their correct values) within the time limit will move to 2nd round.<br>
									<u>FINAL ROUND:</u><br>
									#	It tests your circuit designing skill in given ICs, logic gates, breadboard etc.<br>
									#	Before connecting the power supply, the circuit has to be approved by judge.<br>
									#	The circuit designed by participants must give the desired output.<br>
									#	Team completing the circuits first within the time limit will be the winner.<br>
